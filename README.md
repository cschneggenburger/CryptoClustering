# CryptoClustering
UNC AI Bootcamp Module 11 Challenge Repo. 

**Purpose:** In this Challenge, youâ€™ll apply your understanding of the K-means algorithm and principal component analysis (PCA) to classify cryptocurrencies according to their price fluctuations across various timeframes. Specifically, you will examine price changes over intervals spanning 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, 60 days, 200 days, and 1 year.

**Files:** The data used for this challenge is found in the main branch "Resources" folder as file "crypto_market_data.csv". The main file to run the program/challenge is in the main branch as "Crypto_Clustering.ipynb". The main jupyter notebook was sourced from the starter_code that was provided with the challenge instructions. 

**Libraries, Classes, Methods and Functions used:** 
    - pandas as pd
    - sklearn.cluster import KMeans
    - sklearn.decomposition import PCA
    - sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

**Summary:**
    - All findings and answers to questions are contained in markdown cells in the main jupyter notebook, "Crypto_Clustering.ipynb".
